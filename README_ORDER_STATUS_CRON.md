## üß™ Testing

### Manual Test Script

```bash
# Dry run (no actual changes)
node scripts/testOrderStatusCron.js --dry-run --verbose

# Test with specific parameters
node scripts/testOrderStatusCron.js --days=1 --limit=10

# Full test run
node scripts/testOrderStatusCron.js --verbose
```

### Test Options
- `--dry-run`: Run without making actual changes
- `--days=N`: Override the processing day limit
- `--limit=N`: Limit number of orders to process
- `--verbose`: Enable detailed logging
- `--skip-validation`: Skip system validation checks

## üîç Monitoring & Health Checks

### Health Check Endpoint
```
GET /cron/health/order-status-update
```

Response:
```json
{
  "status": "running",
  "schedule": "0 0 * * *",
  "processingDayLimit": 3,
  "stats": {
    "lastRun": "2023-12-01T00:00:00.000Z",
    "totalRuns": 150,
    "successfulRuns": 148,
    "failedRuns": 2,
    "ordersProcessed": 1250,
    "paymentsProcessed": 890,
    "disputesHandled": 45
  },
  "uptime": 86400
}
```

### Manual Trigger Endpoint
```
POST /cron/trigger/order-status-update
```

## üîÑ Dispute Handling

### Dispute States
- **PENDING**: New dispute, not yet reviewed
- **UNDER_REVIEW**: Admin is reviewing the dispute
- **RESOLVED**: Admin has made a decision
- **CANCELLED**: Dispute was cancelled

### Order Status Logic with Disputes

1. **Active Disputes** (PENDING/UNDER_REVIEW):
   - Orders are **skipped** in status updates
   - No automatic progression until dispute is resolved

2. **Resolved Disputes**:
   - Orders can proceed with status updates
   - Payment calculations include dispute adjustments
   - Admin decision determines payment amounts:
     - **SELLER favor**: Full payment (100%)
     - **BUYER favor**: Adjusted payment (100% - dispute percentage)

### Payment Calculations with Disputes

```javascript
// Example: Buyer wins 30% dispute on ‡∏ø1000 order
Original Amount: ‡∏ø1000
Dispute Adjustment: ‡∏ø1000 * (100% - 30%) = ‡∏ø700
Service Charge: ‡∏ø700 * 5% = ‡∏ø35
Tax: ‡∏ø700 * 7% = ‡∏ø49
Net to Seller: ‡∏ø700 - ‡∏ø35 - ‡∏ø49 = ‡∏ø616
```
